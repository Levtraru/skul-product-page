          has happened countless times before. What makes this time different
          though, is that the Adventurers decided to join forces with the
          Imperial Army and the 'Hero of Caerleon' to lead a full onslaught in
          hopes of wiping out the Demons once and for all. They attacked the
          Demon stronghold with overwhelming numbers and succeeded in its total
          destruction. All of the demons in the castle were taken prisoner
          except for one lone skeleton named 'Skul'.</span

          its own unique attack range, speed and power. Choose combos that match
          your playing style and switch them in the heat of battle to bring your
